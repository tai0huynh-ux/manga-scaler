# AI Manga Upscaler project state

The detailed verified baseline is maintained in [`docs/project-memory/CURRENT_STATE.md`](docs/project-memory/CURRENT_STATE.md). This file is the concise repository-root status required for recovery.

## Current checkpoint

- Project: `manga-scaler` / AI Manga Upscaler.
- Repository: `https://github.com/tai0huynh-ux/manga-scaler.git`.
- Branch: `main`.
- Starting baseline for the protected-read lifecycle checkpoint: `83c0c2ebc67ff8c7daa3414628fd599b3205a758`.
- Protected-read lifecycle checkpoint: real Edge worker termination/reactivation, same-tab navigation, and unpacked-extension reload are green with 47 backend tests, 126 extension tests, JavaScript syntax checks, Ruff, and 71% backend coverage on 2026-07-18.
- Completed: viewport-aware discovery, operation-safe scheduling, transactional long-image slicing, backend inference lifecycle, provider fallback, text-processing foundations, tracing, and native-host startup support.
- Not yet proven: representative live-site acceptance, production-model quality benchmarks, OCR/text-edit acceptance, reliability soak, and clean installer lifecycle.

## Active milestone

Complete the Processing Monitor in the isolated `c518` worktree. Schema version 1 and its security/state-machine contract are verified; runtime lifecycle storage, DOM-commit terminal authority, Dashboard timeline/details, safe previews, cancel/retry, recovery, and load/E2E acceptance remain in progress. Manga and Manhua live acceptance stays green; heavy Manhwa and hentaivnx limitations remain unchanged.
